# My Python Learning Diary 🌼🐍

This repo is my little diary as I learn Python!  
Every file here is something I tried, tested, or practiced while exploring coding.

### What I’m practicing:
- Print & basic commands  
- If/else, loops, and functions  
- Small games and logic challenges  
- Anything I’m curious about 🧸

Nothing here is perfect — it’s just me learning at my own pace 💛
